2011 the elder scrolls v: skyrim
  awake
  from past to present
  unbroken road
  ancient stones
  the city gates
  dragonsreach
  tooth and claw
  under an ancient sun
  distant horizons
  the jerall mountains
  secunda
  imperial throne
  into darkness
  kyne's peace
  far horizons
  a winter's tale
  the bannered mare
  the white river
  beneath the ice
  tundra
  journey's end
  out of the cold
  around the fire
  aurora
  towers and shadows
  seven thousand steps
  solitude
  the gathering storm
  sky above, voice within
  wind guide you

2015 ori and the blind forest
  calling out
  first steps into sunken glades
  thornfelt swamp
  down the moon grotto
  the ancestral trees
  gumo's hideout
  climbing the ginso tree
  the waters cleansed
  home of the gumon

2020 ori and the will of the wisps
  theme
  separated by the storm
  a shine upon inkwater marsh
  overlooking the mill
  kwolok's hollow
  dashing and bashing
  sanctuary in the glades
  silent woodlands
  ash and bone
  shadows of mouldwood
  midnight burrows
  baur's peak
  shriek's tale
  the windswept wastes
  burrowing
  approaching the ruins
  the windtorn ruins
  willow's end
  decay
